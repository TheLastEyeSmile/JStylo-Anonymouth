 This book is an attempt to solve a diverse set of issues.   Energy systems throughout the world and the reigning called into question as longevity resource increasing uncertain.   At the same time, many (if not most) Government and industry leaders are ready to acknowledge that requires a wide range of technological innovations. On top of that all climate change has begun, knocking on everyone's door. In response to the widespread lack of meaningful action on the part of those who control the resources necessary for the implementation of this activity, many communities have begun to examine their own variations.   This is the realm of distributed or decentralized generation, the idea that energy must be generated closer to the point where it is consumed.   For some distributed generation from renewable technologies, all but inevitable (Borbï¿½ly Kreider and 2001).   For others are renewable technologies just as likely to corporate technologies (Bookchin 1980).   The issue is the way in which introduces new energy technologies.   It is possible that renewable energies will simply replace conventional energy generation technologies.   However, if communities and technology are introduced one to the other in the right way, distributed, renewable generation could mean dramatic social change social systems around the world. This document begins with a brief discussion of distributed generation and renewable technologies that most usual lend themselves for a decentralised energy system.   Fit discussion autonomous community of Navarra, Spain and evolution of environmental consciousness of this Spain how big the implementation technology of Navarre study on decentralized, renewable energy technologies-will highlight the methods chosen to fit the system of society is not the other way around. Finally, the paper closes with an exploration of the social implications of distributed energy systems a deeper historical societies affected by a centralized energy systems. In the United States, it is estimated that a significant increase in demand and the withdrawal of the United forces and numerous plants will require top "1.7 trillion kWh of additional electricity by 2020" (Chambers, 2001: 8).   It is estimated price tag of $ 1100 km w h "6 miles power line" customers running each add 3 MW (Chambers 2001: 22 ?. Finally, consider the estimated loss of energy during long distance transmission: up to 5% in the US and as high as 30% in developing countries.  The energy market shows no signs of slowing down, and there are clear incentives for a more efficient and less costly alternative to centralized systems. Enter the distributed and decentralised generation. Response to economic, technical and environmental problems, on the basis of renewable distributed generation modes offer potential savings on costs, transmission and distribution, power loss during transmission and considerable environmental damage caused by a massive central building projects. Distributed or decentralized generation is nothing new. Indeed, prior to the construction of commercial electric systems, more energy was produced at the location, it was consumed: homes, wheel hydraulic, steam, etc.
