 When I finally got to the table, I'm surprised (although somewhat satisfied) from the fact that the waiter didn't appear to speak English. I was not on the tour so far, seafood, seafood soup with garlic and I therefore their shrimp seafood, this place specializes in order after. The waiter has an Exchange with his wife supposedly in the kitchen. N � o � and. He promises, but to me a reasonable replacement, or so I think. They were given the order. The house wine and water a Jarro quickly follow. While soup is great usually Bisque shrimp brain of Mediterranean (Yes, I know of the Atlantic Lisbon) and a generous amount of taste. Maybe that's where all their prawns disappeared.  My mystery main dish below: small clams and cockles. I have to be honest and say I'm a bit disappointed; and Tony in his book explains the dangers of trusting others in the cooking of Bivalves, but these small missiles so I'm going to work hard for my a beautiful. However, all bookings are lost after my first taste. The sauce has been cooked, seemed irresistible blend of olive oil, butter, garlic, coriander and onion delicious natural liquor. My dish was empty after a pile of shells, the waiter reemerged to see if I wanted to desert. He did not bring a menu because the deserts are not on the menu (or if they are, they are probably not the wife decided to make deserts and cooling case last night). I lay a little better this time of course trust me his hand again. What seems to be a kind of divine, pudding-like, seemingly flourless chocolate cake. Delicious. It is dawn and I am a small beach to the station to hop a train to Estoril, city once as a holiday spot for Victorian European royalty, but know, known above all for his glittering casino. I briefly visited Estoril on my first trip to Portugal; I stayed in Cascais, the neighboring city, which is only fifteen minutes walk (or five minutes moped ride, such as it was) down from the coast. In some aspects strictly related, Atlantic City is Las Vegas as Estoril is Monte Carlo; However, this analogy is largely degrading to Estoril and Monte Carlo. Checking into the hotel, opposite the Casino, and rush over to the place of the Conference, on the outskirts of Cascais, is only ten minutes walk away. The Conference, a bit surprisingly, decided to have a catered lunch for the participants for all but one of the days, which is very handy. Because economies in Estoril and Cascais driven almost solely by tourism and gambling, there are many kind of restaurants available for lunch (Marx was probably not too keen on gambling).
