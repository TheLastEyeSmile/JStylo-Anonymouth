 When I finally am beckoned to a table, I'm (although somehow comforted) surprised by the fact that the waiter apparently not to speak English. I have seafood not yet on this trip and this place is specialized in seafood, so I the seafood followed by their shrimp order soup in garlic. The waiter is a Exchange with his alleged wife in the kitchen. Mais N� � o. He, however, I find a proper replacement, or so I believe to promises. However, my order placed. House wine and water immediately followed by Jarro. The soup is a wonderful, typical Mediterranean (Yes, I know Lisbon is on the Atlantic Ocean) bisque with generous amounts of shrimp brains for body and taste. Perhaps this is where all their shrimp disappeared.  My next mystery main course: tiny clams and cockles, appears. I have to be honest and say that I am little disappointed; not only is Tony explained in his book the dangers of the trust of others in the kitchen of Bivalves, but these shells are so small that I'm going to have to work pretty hard for my meal. All reservations are, however, lost, after my first taste. The broth in which they were cooked, seemed to be an irresistible combination of olive oil, butter, garlic, coriander, onions and delicious natural liquor. After converting my dish to the pile of empty shells, the waiter reappeared to see if I wanted to desert. He does not bring a menu because they aren't the deserts on the menu (or, if they are, are probably not the same deserts his wife decided to make and implement in the case of cooling last night). I put my fate in his hands, once again this time with a bit more well-deserved confidence. What seems to be some divine kind of chocolate cake, pudding, apparently without flour. Delicious. Get up early, I train station of Estoril, a small town in the North Atlantic coast vacation spot for once as in Victorian era royalty, but is primarily known for its trendy Casino. I briefly visited Estoril on my first trip to the Portugal; I am stay in Cascais, the nearby city, which is only a 15 minute walk (or five minutes of moped ride, as was) side down. In some respects strictly relative is Atlantic City to Las Vegas as Estoril to Monte Carlo; However, such an analogy is to a large extent degrading both Estoril and Monte Carlo. I check in to your hotel, opposite the Casino and rush to the venue of the Conference, on the outskirts of the town of Cascais, just a 10-minute walk from the hotel. A little surprising is, meetings, decided to have pleasure of lunch one day, but all the participants are very convenient. Given the fact that Cascais and Estoril the economies are driven almost exclusively by tourism and gambling, there is not much of my kind restaurants for lunch available (Marx probably would not have been very enthusiastic about the gambling).
