 I ate a sandwich at the hospital cafeteria, when I felt a tap on my shoulder. A woman asked, "do you remember me? "? Initially, the connection could not be established. Then she said, "you helped my son." And I remember.                                                                        It's the first day of my Pediatric rotation, today I have predicted for years. Because I always a supporter of the child had considered me, the next few weeks would test if my passion for helping children would translate into my career. It was time to go around. I sat around the Conference table, listening intently. Then we start talking about a mystery: a 5 years old boy acknowledged the high fever, neck stiffness, and negative history of spinal tap. I was intrigued by the clinical thought process, which the medical team was engaging. Every day, the boy developed a different clinical features. In an attempt to help, I have my free time trying to identify a diagnosis that would be good for his various symptoms and signs. And I started to realize that there were certain attributes of child medicine that I wanted to include in my future career. Those that were extremely ill or chronically ill children with diagnosed with challenging enjoyed working with. This experience, as well as other during my child's allowed me to gain insight into my professional objectives. I knew that I wanted to specialize in pediatric medicine, but to maintain a comprehensive background in General Pediatrics. A week in the hospital course, the team decided that boy he probably an atypical form of Kawasaki disease had. The boy's mother she will agree with many unnecessary steps, made clear that no. Besides, we were on a time clock. Intravenous gamma globulin Kawasaki disease treatment must be administered in the first 10 days of the onset of illness. It was day 10. As someone who was involved with the research, was fascinating to experience their clinical applications. In college I was helping the research team that tested the effects of oral albuterol on muscle atrophy in boys with dystrophenopathies. Then I was in medical school, a study examines compliance with asthmatic children in the city involved. The understanding I've gained during these clinical studies allowed me to develop my experiments a scientific curiosity, skills, and experience in clinical research.  After getting approval of the staff, I sat with the boy's mother, go about articles about Kawasaki disease and its treatment. The family agreed the gamma globulin therapy. In this situation, I moved from my personal strengths such as determination, hard work, compassion and curiosity. In addition, I used my experiences as a guide to interact with this family. My experience, gives flu shots for homeless HIV positive community in South Bronx taught me to pay attention, because everyone has a story worth hearing. As a member of a crisis hotline, I learned to ease the art of listening and how you have a intense conversation.
