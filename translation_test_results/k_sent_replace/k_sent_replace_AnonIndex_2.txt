 Matter of personal taste or moral code which often arrive disguised as concern for aesthetic merit. Provision of aesthetic judgment necessarily includes imports made sense and decency in our experience of a work of art, whether that assessment is steeped in traditional morality or staunch opposition to it. Is art that justify to measure the social value of Kara Walker's work this in mind first of all difficult or controversial General existence and intended audience is that should be distributed concept. It would not make sense to introduce the conversation to the question whether their art should exist and should we assume at the beginning of a preliminary agreement on the right of the Kara Walker, art making that it does whether its presence to the advantage or disadvantage of the African-American community in particular is. The more interesting question then becomes one on the location of this art in the popular consciousness as high touted Gallery, one of the interpretation of the tariff implications of the positive attention that Walker has received in the world commercial art and the impact of this work on the mentality of the people who encounter. Walker's art, at root, a major challenge for the African American Community or an expanded insult to her current causes? Is his claim that engage us the full scope of our rich history, difficulty rather than thin deliberately this story by stating uplifting images imported purely from the imagination sufficient to justify the presence of harmful images in his work? How can identify us the difference between the work that simply capitalizes on the provocative images and one who wants to use these same images but ironically and fraught with new meaning, to initiate a dialogue more productive and more realistic? I will argue in this document that Walker's work, while provocative, breaks suddenly we today of art that is meant to be subversive expect, that it's more than benefits suffers his status as postmodern. Will say that Kara Walker is worth praise, because it provides a challenge to the social world and the world of commercial art, but that is a call that is less interesting than it would like to be. The volatility of the cultural moments that for the creation of her work and the occasional serve ' � � as a work of art, in its simplicity, depends on the contextuality and presentation ' � � will probably ensure that its legacy is not sustainable. Pharr-Robert f. Reid, in his essay ' Girl Lost, � � Black ' �� introduces the next if stock criticism of Walker, but it nevertheless sends us to the controversy that still surrounds her work. Reid-Pharr wants to go further than the binary structure that is supposed to be a crusader or an opportunist Walker and delve into the obscurities that lead of her work.
