Making aesthetic judgment necessarily involves import our own senses nourished of the evaluation and the decency of our experience of a work of art, if this assessment is rooted in traditional morality or in opposition to it. With this in mind, in an attempt to measure social value to the work of Kara Walker, first cutting out the idea that art is difficult or controversial must justify its existence to the supposed audience or the general public. The question is whether her art to be present for negotiations and not to introduce meaningful benefit or their presence, especially to the detriment of African American community that a tentative agreement that we, the art of Kara Walker for initially about the right of the value.

Pharr-Robert f. Reid, in his essay ' Girl Lost, � � Black ' �� introduces the next if stock criticism of Walker, but it nevertheless sends us to the controversy that still surrounds her work. Reid-Pharr wants to go further than the binary structure that is supposed to be a crusader or an opportunist Walker and delve into the obscurities that lead of her work.
