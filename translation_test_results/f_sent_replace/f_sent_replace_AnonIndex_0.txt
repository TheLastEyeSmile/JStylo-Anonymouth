 When I finally called for a table, the fact that the waiter does not appear to speak English though surprised by (somehow consoles). I had no seafood even more on this trip, and this place, which specializes in seafood so I can order the seafood soup, followed by their shrimp in garlic. The waiter has exchanges with his wife apparently in the kitchen. N = � � o continue. He promises, even though I get appropriate compensation, or so I believe. In this connection, my order has been placed. According to Jarro house wine and water in a timely manner. Soup is a beautiful, typically Mediterranean Sea (Yes, I know it is the Lisbon strategy for the Atlantic) with a generous quantity of prawn bisque for body and brain the taste. This is perhaps where all their shrimp disappeared.  My mystery main course will appear next: tiny mussels, and clams. I must be honest and say that I am disappointed enthusiast; not only Tony explains in his book the dangers of trusting others in the kitchen of bivalves, but these shells are so tiny that I will have to work very hard for my meal. All reservations however after my first taste is lost. The broth in which they were cooked, apparently the irresistible combination of olive oil, butter, garlic, coriander, onion and the delicious natural liquor. After converting my dish to a slew of empty shells, lectures series of the waiter to see if I wanted to desert. He didn't mention the offer because of the desert, which are not in the menu (or, if they are, you probably are not the same desert that his wife, who decided to do and put in the case of refrigeration of yesterday). I live once again my fate in his hands, this time with a little more well deserved confidence. Up to seems to be a sort of divine chocolate cake, such as candy, florls apparently. Delicious. Is the crack of dawn and I went to the Centre for hop train to Estoril, a small city of Atlantic Beach, once known as a vacation spot for the Kings the Victorian era, but we know mostly known for the attractive Casino. I briefly loved on my first trip to Portugal; I stayed around Cascais city, which is only about 15 minutes walk (or a five minute ride mopeds because it is) down the coast. In some respects, strictly relative, Atlantic City is in Las Vegas as the Estoril is the Monte Carlo; But such analogies, it is in large part the humiliating for the Estoril and Monte Carlo. I check in my hotel, opposite the Casino and rush over to the headquarters of the Conference which, in the outskirts of Cascais, is only a 10 minute walk. Decided that catered to my surprise a little meeting, all of the participants in the Bento is one day for very useful. View, economy is almost entirely made up of Cascais and Estoril tourism and gambling, not a lot of my favorite type of restaurant available for launch (probably Marx would have been very keen on gambling).
