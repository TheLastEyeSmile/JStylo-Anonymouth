 Nobody likes really it, and if it's free it is always the last to go. Our Office has leftover halloween candy sitting out in the cafï¿½ and it is about 1/3 banana laffy taffy, 1/2 small tootsie pops, and the rest is a mix. Here started with the amount of strawberries and banana laffy Taffy. Sooner if the worlds candy makers stop forcing banana on us, how better. Technically, every day I get free meals. But today's lunch was better cause we went out to a new place across the street to celebrate the news is almost finished the Asian. This place is pretty sweet, we had lettuce wraps which never before had. They are practically a bunch of lettuce leaves and good things to scoop them using lettuce as a taco shell type thing.

So after the match, the non-host packed and drove 3 hours. 3 Hours of driving is not exactly you put in the atmosphere to help construct and devour a massive dinner. So the plan was formed, Turkey is the Black Friday!

Among the choices of food was steak, Turkey, multiple pastas and Rices, sushi, mini burgers, pigs in a blanket, and a lot of other things that I can't even remember.
