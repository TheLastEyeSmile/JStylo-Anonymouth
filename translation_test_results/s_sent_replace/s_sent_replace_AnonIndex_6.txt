 I was eating a sandwich in the hospital cafeteria, when I felt a blow on my shoulder. "You remember me?" a woman asked. At first, I cannot make a connection. Then she said, "you have helped my son." And I remembered.                                                                        It was the first day of my Pediatrics rotation, the day that I had been anticipating for years. Because I had always considered an Ombudsperson for children, the next few weeks could prove if my passion for helping children would result in my future career. This time round. I sat around the table, conference rooms, listening intently. Then we began to discuss an Enigma: a five-year-old boy was admitted with a history of high fever, stiff neck and a negative lumbar puncture. I was intrigued by the process of clinical thinking, where the medical team was attractive. Every day, the boy has developed various clinical features. In an attempt to help, I spent my free time trying to identify a diagnosis that would explain its various symptoms and signs. And me di account were specific attributes of pediatric medicine that I wanted to include in my future career. I enjoyed working with children with challenging Diagnostics along with those who were very sick or chronic. This experience, as well as other pediatric during my Clerkship enabled me insight into my professional goals. I knew I wanted to specialize in pediatric medicine, but maintain an extensive background in General Pediatrics. One week into the boy's Hospital course, the team decided that the atypical form of Kawasaki disease probably had. The boy's mother made sure she did not want to accept more unnecessary procedures. In addition, we were on a time clock. Treatment for Kawasaki, intravenous gammaglobulin disease, it must be managed within the first ten days of the onset of the disease. It was the day ten. Been involved with research studies, it was fascinating to learn their clinical applications. Helped oral albuterol on muscle atrophy in the dystrophenopathies boys in the University laboratory for testing. Involved in research, looking for observance of inner city asthmatic children in medical school after that. Understanding I gained during these clinical studies allowed me to sharpen my skills, develop a scientific curiosity, experimentation and experience in clinical research.  After obtaining the approval of the staff, I sat with the boy's mother, through articles on Kawasaki disease and its treatment. The family consented to the gamma globulin therapy. Throughout this situation, I drew from my personal priority, for example, determination, industriousness, compassion and inquisitiveness. In addition, I used my past experience as a guide by interacting with this family. My experience flu shots to give to the homeless HIV positive community in the South Bronx taught me to pay attention, because each person has a story worth hearing. As a member of the crisis hotline, I learned the art of listening and how to enable the intensive conversation.
