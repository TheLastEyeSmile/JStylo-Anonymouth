 This is the ideal resolution for users to be able to see the world that surrounds them. Christopher ï¿½ T. gun is Derai University in sensory substitution group head. He graduated from Drexel University with his PhD. in computer science and medical technology. Replace the electric touch interface senses the tactile development he displays over 20 years of experience and over is. We further research on this subject has been before. There are many improvements and safety measures that must be addressed to make this product available to the public. Such a possibility, which this device can be improved is the hardware. For the whole day use, the device is very cumbersome and impractical to wear. The first thing we would like to focus on the size of the base unit. Most users this big box is attached to the waist. This and many other activities along the way. What we want to do is create a much larger base unit that can be put on the shirt or pants. Another item that we want to improve the image of the camera is. We want to build these three cameras in a few glasses that the information to the base unit then Wireless will pass. Finally the needs for comfort, we would design the tray to hold the display language on the spot. Not only would it more comfortable for the user, but it also keeps a solid starting point for the image that users see. A further improvement that we want to achieve, lowers the cost of the device. At this time, the BrainPort is 5,000. The price is very affordable for most people. We would like to further research on how to use the devices and cheap to mimic the advanced devices we use in our current form. Finally, we would like to look at the effects of the use of this device. BrainPort technology has all the side effects of long term on the device is not using the account. Further other roles have passed in this topic describes to users who have used the BrainPort technology for a couple of hours to say that they have a slight metallic taste in the mouth then. Perhaps this metallic taste may lead to loss of taste together? We would like to make users test to see if they are the side effects of the use of this device. From this research, we hope to create a tool for the blind or partially sighted users, individuals, but also help other disabilities and research. This technique can help improve the way an area of vestibular balance disorders, especially those with disorders. Our product would help improve balance, gait, posture, and other similar symptoms. Vestibular disease is classified as a regular hangover, those who have impaired sense of balance.[ Vestibular disorders are classified as individuals who are often dizzy and have an impaired sense of balance.]
