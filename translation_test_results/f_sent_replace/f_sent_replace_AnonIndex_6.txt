 When I'm finally beckoned to the table, I'm surprised (although somehow comforted) by the fact that it does not appear that the waiter speak English. I haven't had a seafood still on this trip, and this place specializes in seafood so I seafood shrimp soup followed by their ordering in garlic. Waiters in an interchange with wife with kitchen. N � o � mais. He promises, however, to find me a reasonable substitute, or so I think. With that, my order was placed. A Jarro house wine and water immediately follow. The soup is a wonderful, typical Mediterranean (Yes, I know Lisbon is on Atlantic) bisque with generous amounts of brains of shrimp for the body and flavor. Maybe this is where all their shrimp disappeared.  My mystery main dish: tiny clams and clams appears next. I have to be honest and say that I am disappointed; Not only is Tony in his book in the kitchen of the dangers to relying on others Bivalves, but interpreting these shells that I have to work very hard for my food I'm going to be very small. All orders have been lost, however, after my first taste. The broth in which they were cooked seems to be the irresistible combination of olive oil, butter, garlic, coriander, onion and delicious natural liquor. After converting my dish a bunch of empty shells, the waiter again to see if I wanted to desert. He did not bring a menu because the deserts are not on the menu (or, if they are, they are probably not the same deserts that his wife decided to make and, in the case of cooling last night). Once again I was lying in his hand, my fate a bit more well-deserved confidence. What comes, seems to be a sort of divine, pudding as seemingly flourless chocolate cake. Delicious. It is dawn and I headed to the station to hop a train in Estoril, a small Atlantic Beach town, once known as a vacation spot for European royalty of the Victorian era, but know, known mainly for the glamorous Casino. I briefly visited Estoril for my first trip to Portugal; I was staying in the nearby towns of Cascais, just a 15-minute walk (or five minutes ride a moped, as it were) down the coast. In some respects strictly relative is Atlantic City to Las Vegas as Estoril to Monte Carlo; This analogy is however mostly demeaning for Estoril and Monte Carlo. I check into my hotel, opposite the Casino, and rush over to the location of the Conference which, at the edge of Cascais, only a ten-minute walk. A little surprise, the Conference decided to have lunch care to attend to each of the days, but which is very convenient. Given that the Cascais and Estoril in the economy almost exclusively driven by tourism and gambling, there are not many of my type of restaurants available for lunch (probably not Marx were very interested in gambling).
