 "Claude gueux" certainly makes it easy to identify with the main character, a victim of unfortunate circumstances Ho feels need to steal to provide food and shelter for his family. It's a pity for him, he has a repeated where the warden, in every possible way it tortures jailed her family to feed as your effort to not feel. So, you feel a sense of Justice, when the Gueux eventually kills the warden, and the great injustice when sentenced to death and executed Gueux eventually murder.  To start the event, follow the same pattern seen interesting many social protest novel that Hugo's ridiculously unrealistic piling up find the accident after accident. In a few pages and four years, the beggar is jailed, said that his wife had become a prostitute, to say that her child has disappeared, makes a friend he lost and was sentenced to death for the murder of the man who had been malevolent him for a long time. This story seems to need some number of willing to pause may accept anyone as good as Claude ï¿½ Gueux so good people can be broken down so easy, full of incredible social injustice. The story of suffering from this too much of an issue, but I do not know or that it's a long story, a novel-like format without making the story more reliable that could be customized.  Is sometimes very sharp, author comments. Repeatedly makes sarcastic remarks about the evils of society. Change a gel, and one altar to an Abbey to become a pillory, they are speaking of "progress." At the end of the story, the author changes the voice Narrator to the records referred repeatedly to the problems in the current state of society. Author, than I can't imagine why any he had problems expressing the story to say that. Seems to me a lot trying to find their voice, Hugo-he knows exactly what he wants to say, but still express it to fleshing out the right way.  All, however, was quite fun to read. Despite that, a little predictable, as a reader, some that could be used at the end of the story, the death of the Gueux land that Hugo was a pretty creative craftsman. It's easy to empathize with the Gueux, as the man who was just trying to do what he had to care for his family. Hugo has a well developed idea of what being a human good, and what is a bad. He realizes that most people agree that if you steal a man to take care of his family, the problem is not with the man but the circumstances that lead to the need to steal.
