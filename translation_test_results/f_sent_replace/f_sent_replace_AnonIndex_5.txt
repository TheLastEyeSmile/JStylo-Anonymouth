 When I finally beckoned me to the table, I was surprised (although somehow comforted by) the fact that the waiter did not appear to speak English. I haven't had a seafood still on this trip, and this place specializes in seafood so I seafood shrimp soup followed by their ordering in garlic. The server has an Exchange with his wife alleged in the kitchen. Nï¿½? o mais? However, he promised to make me a reasonable replacement, or so I believe. With that, my order was placed. A Jarro of house wine and water follow quickly. Soup is a wonderful, typically Mediterranean (Yes, I know that Lisbon is on Atlantic) body and taste Lobster bisque with generous amounts of the brain. Perhaps this is where did all their shrimp.  My mystery main dish: tiny clams and clams appears next. I have to be honest and say that I'm a little disappointed; not only did Tony explained in his book the danger of trusting others in the culinary art of oyster shells, but these are so small that I will have to work hard enough on my food. All reservations, however, after my first taste, are lost. The Broth in which they were cooked seems to be the irresistible combination of olive oil, butter, garlic, coriander, onion and delicious natural beverage. After the shells empty my plate on a bunch of, come back to the fore of waiters to see if I desert wanted to. He did not provide a menu because the deserts are not on the menu (or, if they are, they are probably not same as his wife deserts has decided to put in the case of refrigeration last night). Once again, I put my fate in his hands, this time with a bit more well deserved trust. What arrive seems to have been some form of sacred, budingyang, appear to have flour chocolate cake. Delicious. It's the cherries of the day and I'm headed to the station to hop a train to Estoril, a small Atlantic Beach town ever known as a vacation spot for European royalty Victorian era, but know the glitzy casino usually known. I briefly visited Estoril on my first trip to Portugal; I was staying in Cascais, the neighboring city, which is only a 15-minute walk (or bike ride five minutes, as was) down the coast. In some respects strictly relative Atlantic City, Las Vegas, Estoril is in Monte Carlo; However, this analogy is severely degrading Estoril and Monte Carlo. I check into my hotel, opposite the Casino, and rush over to the location of the Conference which, at the edge of Cascais, only a ten-minute walk. The Conference, which is a bit surprising, decided to have a lunch to attendees for all but one of the days, which is quite convenient. Given that Cascais and Estoril's economy driven by tourism and gambling are almost exclusively, there are only a few of my type of restaurant available for lunching (Marx probably would not have been very interested in gambling).
