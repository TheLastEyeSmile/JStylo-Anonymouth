 Was eating a sandwich in the hospital cafeteria, when I felt the faucet on my shoulder. "You know me yet?" asked a woman. At first, couldn't I cannot connect. She said, "you for my son". And I remembered.                                                                        It was the first day of my rotation in Pediatrics, the day that I had anticipated for years. Because I have always thought that advocates for their children, in the coming weeks will test if I describe the children's enthusiasm translates into my future career. It was time to finish. I was sitting at the table conference room, carefully listening to. Then we started to discuss enigma: a five-year-old boy was admitted with a high fever, stiff neck and a history of negative Spinal Tap. I was intrigued by the process of clinical thinking, in which the medical team was engaged. Each day, the boy develop different clinical features. Trying to identify the account of his various signs and symptoms and diagnosis to help, and spent his spare time. And began to realize that there are certain features of Pediatrics that I wanted to include in my career future. I loved working with children with challenging diagnoses, along with those who were extremely ill or chronically ill. During this experience, as well as others in my Pediatric internship allows our deeper understanding of my professional goals. I knew that I was in the pediatric medicine to wanted to specialize and still maintain a comprehensive background in General Pediatrics. One week in hospital the boy of course, the Panel determined that it was probably a form of atypical of Kawasaki disease. The boy's mother made it clear that it would not accept more unnecessary procedures. In addition, we were in a clock. Kawasaki disease, intravenous gamma globulins, ten days before beginning to treat disease within to be administered. It was day one. After having been involved in research studies, it's fascinating to discover their clinical applications. During college, I was a research team that boys in muscle atrophy at oral albuterol with dystrophenopathies effects of testing support. Then, in medical school I was involved in a study looking for compliance among asthmatic children in the inner city. The understanding that I have acquired in these clinical studies have me to hone my skills of experimentation, develop scientific curiosity and experience in clinical research.  After obtaining the approval of the staff, I sat down with mother, reviewing articles about Kawasaki disease and its treatment. Agreed with gamma globulin in the treatment of the family. In this case the entire drawing from my personal strengths, such as determination, hard work, compassion, and curiosity. In addition, I used my past experience as a guide in the interaction with this family. My experience giving flu shots to the HIV positive community homeless in the South Bronx taught me to pay attention, because each person has a history of audience. As a member of a crisis hotline, I learned the art of listening and how to facilitate an intense conversation.
