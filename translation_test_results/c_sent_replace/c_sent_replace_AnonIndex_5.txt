 This paper is an attempt to deal with a variety of issues.   Energy in the world regimes are questioned as their longevity of resources is increasingly uncertain.   At the same time (in most cases), acknowledge the need for technological innovation, widespread across many Government and industry leaders are reluctant. In all, climate change has begun to knock on each door. As a response to the widespread lack of meaningful action on the part of those who control the resources necessary for the implementation of this action, many communities have begun to examine their own options.   This is the realm of distributed or decentralized generation, the idea that energy must be generated closer to the point where it is consumed.   For some the decentralized power generation with renewable technologies is all but inevitable (Borbï¿½ly and Kreider 2001).   For others are renewable technologies just as likely to corporate technologies (Bookchin 1980).   What matters is the way in which new technologies are introduced.   Potential of renewable energy will only replace conventional energy generation technologies. However, if communities and technology are introduced to each other in the right way, renewable distributed generation, may be dramatic social change social systems around the world. This document begins with a short explanation of distributed generation and these technologies for renewable energy, which are the easiest suitable a decentralised energy system.   Consequently, the debate with the introduction of the decentralised, renewable technologies, in Navarre, Spain, autonomous and how it fits into the larger development of the environmental review of attitude in Spain is trying to highlight the way the technologies were chosen so that the social system in Navarre-not vice versa.   Finally the document closes with the development of deeper social impacts of decentralised energy systems in societies historically influenced by centralized energy systems. In the US alone, it is estimated that the combined forces of a substantial growth of demand and and numerous plant retirements will need up to "1.7 trillion kWh of additional electrical energy by 2020" (Chambers 2001: 8).   Will add to this estimated $ 1,100 per kilowatt hour price label run "six mile power 3 MW customers" (2001: 22). Finally, consider the estimated loss of energy during long distance transmission: up to 5% in the US and as high as 30% in developing countries.  The market for energy not show no signs of slowing down and there are clear incentives for a more efficient and less costly alternative to central systems. Be distributed and decentralised generation. Answer concerns economic, environmental engineering, based on distributed renewable generation regimes offer potential savings on the costs of transmission and distribution, power loss during transmission of significant environmental damage to massive centralized building. Distributed or decentralized generation is nothing new. In fact, before the construction of commercial electrical systems, more energy produced where it is consumed: fireplaces, wheels of water, steam, etc.
