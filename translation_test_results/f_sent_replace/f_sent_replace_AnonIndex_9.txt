 When I finally came to a table, I am surprised (well that somewhat comforted) by the fact that the boy does not seem to speak English. I have not yet had seafood on this trip and this place specializes in seafood, to order the soup of seafood, followed by their garlic shrimp. The waiter has an Exchange with his supposed wife in the kitchen. N � o � mais. He promises, but to me a reasonable replacement, or so I think. With that, I had placed my order. Promptly follow Jarro water and house wine. The soup is wonderful, typically Mediterranean (Yes, I know Lisbon baatlanti) bisque with generous amounts of brain cancer and for the body. Perhaps this is where all the shrimp are gone.  Receive mystery main course the following: to please the small shellfish. A little honesty say I was disappointed; Tony going only to explain the dangers of trusting in his book other clams and these shells have quite hard work for my meal there in very slightly. All reservations are lost, but after my first taste. The broth in which Cook seems to be the irresistible combination of oil of olive, butter, garlic, cilantro, onion and delicious natural liquor. After transforming my packet to a stack of empty shells, the waiter came to see if I wanted to. He is not a desert menu (or same desert is probably making his wife in that case, put in freezer cases last night for not), doesn't have the menu. Once again I was my fate in his hands, this time with a bit more worthy of trust. What seems to be a kind of divine, pudding-like, seemingly flourless chocolate cake. Delicious. This is the crack of dawn and I am headed to the station to hop a train to Estoril, an Atlantic Beach town once known as holiday for the royalty Victorian European, but knowledge known especially for his lavish casino. I briefly visited Estoril on my first trip to Portugal; I stayed in Cascais, the neighboring city, which is only fifteen minutes walk (or five minutes moped ride, such as it was) down from the coast. In some respects strictly for Atlantic City is in Las Vegas as Estoril is in Monte-Carlo; However, such analogy is largely degrading to Estoril and Monte-Carlo. I was in my hotel, opposite the Casino, check-in and fall through the Conference Hotel on the outskirts of Cascais, only a ten minute walk away is. The Conference decided to somewhat surprising way, to have a meal catering for participants of all the days, which is very convenient. Because of Cascais and Estoril savings depend almost exclusively on tourism and the game, he did many of my type of restaurants available to launch (Marx probably would not have been very keen on gambling).
