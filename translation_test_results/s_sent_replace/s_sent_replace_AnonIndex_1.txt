 Tap me on the shoulder was eating sandwiches in the hospital cafeteria when you feel the. "You remember me?" a woman asked. At first, I could not make a connection. Then she said, "You my son helped." I remembered.                                                                        This was my Pediatric rotation, I have always been looking forward to for many years of the day on the first day of. Because I was always considered myself a child advocate, the next weeks to check my passion for helping children to translate my career. It was time for the round. I sat around a conference room table, listening carefully. Then we started to discuss a mystery: were adopted five year old boy with a history of high fever, stiff neck and negative spinal tap. I was fascinated by the clinical thought process, where the medical team was appealing. Every day, the boy for different clinical features. In an effort to help diagnose my spare time that would account for the various symptoms and signs to identify. I understand that there were specific features of medicine Pediatrics I want to include my career future. I enjoyed working with children with challenging diagnoses together with those who were extremely ill or chronically ill. This experience, as well as others during my clerkship Pediatrics allowed me to btobna my professional goals. I knew that I specialize in pediatric medicine, yet a comprehensive background to maintain in General Pediatrics. Guy's Hospital course, a week the team decided that the most likely form an atypical Kawasaki disease. The boy's mother said that she would not approve further unnecessary actions. Furthermore, we were time clock. The treatment for Kawasaki disease, intravenous gamma globulins, needed to be administered within the first 10 days of illness ... It was 10 days. Involved in research and clinical experience was fascinating. In college, I helped a team of researchers who tested the effects of oral albuterol on muscular atrophy in males with dystrophenopathies. Then, in the school of medicine, I participated in a study on bonding between asthmatic children in the inner city. Understanding that I got during these clinical studies allowed me to hone my skills, development of scientific curiosity, experimentation and get experience in clinical research.  Sat down and go post about the boy's mother, Kawasaki disease and its treatment after getting the approval from the staff. The family agreed to treatment of gamma globulin. All this I drew from personal strengths such as determination, industriousness, and compassion. Also, I spoke with the family as a guide in your use of past experiences. My experience has taught me to give flu shots to community HIV positive homeless in the South Bronx, where everyone has a story worth hearing. As members of the crisis hotline, I learned to listen to art and how to promote the competitive dialogue.
