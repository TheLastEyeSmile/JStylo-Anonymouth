 I was eating a sandwich in the cafeteria of the hospital, when I felt a tap on my shoulder. A woman asked, "do you remember me?". Initially I couldn't make the connection. Then she said, "my son gave me" And I remembered.                                                                        It was the first day of my Pediatrics rotation, the day that I had been anticipating for years. Because I had always considered myself an advocate, will be a test of the weeks ahead if will translate my passion to help children in my career future. It was time to cycle. I sat around a conference room table, listening intently. When we started to discuss a riddle: a five-year-old boy had been admitted with a history of a high fever, stiff neck, and a negative spinal tap. I think the process by which clinical medical team was intrigued was attractive. Every day he developed young different clinical features. In an attempt to help spent I my free time trying to identify a diagnosis that would explain his various signs and symptoms. And I began to realize that there are certain characteristics of paediatric medicine that I wanted to include in my future career were. Very diagnostic challenge with children enjoyed working with chronic disease or illness. This experience as well as others during my Pediatric internship allowed me to gain insight into my professional goals. I knew I wanted to specialize in pediatric medicine, but maintain an extensive background in General Pediatrics. A week in the course of children's hospital, the team decided to had probably an atypical form of Kawasaki disease. The mother made it clear that she could not allow more unnecessary procedures. In addition, we were on a time clock. Treatment for Kawasaki disease, intravenous gamma globulins, administered within the first ten days needed for the evolution of the disease. It was a day of ten. Having participated with research studies, it was fantastic to experience their clinical applications. While studying I assisted a team that tested the effect of oral albuterol on muscular atrophy in boys with Dystrophenopathies. Then in medical school, I was involved in a study looking at the commitment among asthmatics in the center of the city. The understanding gained through these clinical studies that allowed me to hone my skills development of scientific curiosity, experimentation, and gain experience in clinical research.  After approval is obtained from the staff, I sat the boy's mother, crossing of Kawasaki disease and treatment related articles. The family agreed with the gamma-globulin therapy. Throughout this situation, I draw from my personal strengths such as determination, assiduity, compassion and curiosity. In addition, I used my past experience as a guide in the interaction with the family. My experience flu shots to give to the homeless HIV positive community in the South Bronx taught me to pay attention, because each person has a story worth hearing. Art of listening as a member of the crisis hotline and learned how to promote an intense conversation.
