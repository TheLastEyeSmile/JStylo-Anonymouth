 I was eating a sandwich in the hospital cafeteria, when I tap on my shoulder felt. "You have forgotten? "Woman asked. First of all, I couldn't make a link. She said, "you helped my son." And I remembered.                                                                        My Pediatrics rotation, I was anticipating for years was the first day of the day. Because I always thought care advocate, in the coming weeks will be to check if my passion to help children will translate to my future career. It is time for the tour. I was sitting at the table, Conference room listening. When we started to discuss a riddle: a five-year-old boy had been admitted with a history of a high fever, stiff neck, and a negative spinal tap. I was intrigued by the clinical thought process in which the medical team was interesting. Every day, the boy developed several clinical characteristics. In an attempt to help, I spent my free time trying to determine a diagnosis that would take into account the various symptoms and signs. And I began to realize that there are certain characteristics of paediatric medicine that I wanted to include in my future career were. I enjoyed working with children with difficult diagnoses along with those that were too ill or chronically ill. This experience as well as others during my Pediatric internship allowed me to gain insight into my professional goals. I knew that I wanted to specialize in pediatric medicine, complete everything now training in General Pediatrics. A week in the young hospital course, decided the team, that he most likely had an atypical form of Kawasaki disease. The young mother made it clear that she would agree to no longer unnecessary procedures. In addition, we were on a time clock. This treatment of Kawasaki disease, intravenous gamma globulins, need to be submitted during the first 10 days of onset of the disease. It was a ten day. Was involved with investigations, it was fascinating to experienced their clinical applications. During college, I help the research team, which tested the effects of oral albuterol to muscle atrophy in the boys with the dystrophenopathies. Then, in the school of medicine, I participated in a study on membership in asthmatic children in the city. My experiments allow me to hone my skills, understanding gained during development of these clinical studies of scientific curiosity, and access to clinical research experience. After receiving approval from the staff, I sat with the boy's mother, going over the articles about Kawasaki disease and its treatment. The family agreed with the gamma-globulin therapy. In this situation I pulled from my personal strengths such as provision, activity, compassion and curiosity. In addition, I have used my past experience as a guide in the interaction with the family. My experience giving flu shots to the homeless community HIV positive in the South Bronx has taught me to pay attention, because everyone has a story worth hearing. As a member of the crisis hotline, I learned the art of listening and how to facilitate intensive conversation.
