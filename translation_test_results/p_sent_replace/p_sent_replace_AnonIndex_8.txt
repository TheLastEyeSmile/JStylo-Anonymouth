 While emphasizing the impossibility to make precise quantitative predictions, in the social sciences, in the introduction to the Middle East in international relations, Fred Halliday argues that it is actually the role of these fields on the identification and explanation of the notable current models in the events in the world. Halliday also recognizes that some future evaluation is essential to planning for people "to make sense of their lives." With this broad parameters in mind, may be a better approach to predict the political future; instead of struggling to predict the exact figures for oil export or defence spending, the emphasis should fall on the wider identify trends and make them a rough sketch of the future in service. Extrapolation of the current patterns, however, is, by itself, an inadequate Predictor; the rapid reversal of fortune in Iran after the Islamic revolution is just one example among several in which reality defied widespread perceptions. Rather, a better approach is one that combines the extrapolation of the current situation with comparisons with other relevant historical scenarios. This approach is similar to the "Historical Sociology" stick Halliday joins narratives (the ideographic approach) with the theory (nomothetic alternatives, trying to incorporate the case at hand in a broader context) to a more accurate assessment of the future. In the case of Iraq after the invasion, makes it possible to apply this approach to the assessment of possible options for the future. Three years have passed since the first US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, which is enough time for patterns begin to emerge in the political situation. Started the following new Government Iraq to work remains a revolt against both the occupation of the United States and domestic security apparatus. While these current trends can not fully predict the future, the Iraq is not to ignore dangerously short-sighted to the present social and political realities. In addition, the u.s.-led invasion also fits neatly in a series of great power intervention in the Middle East. Massive body of literature exists that explores the involvement of external forces (typically American, Soviet, British and French military and reconnaissance) in the Affairs of the Middle East is in the details. Although post-invasion Iraq's future will largely affect the specific character of national experiences during the invasion and Saddam ï¿½ Hussein's totalitarian regime, Iraq's experience with Iran, and Afghanistan, and Egypt, or the other end of the similarities and differences between countries can be used as additional components complete understanding, Iraq currently led by the direction. Although it might be impossible to articulate with absolute certainty what will the reality of Iraq in ten to fifteen years, the above analysis instruments can make sorting through the counterfactual futures a more productive effort. Despite the internal discontent growing with the war effort, an American withdrawal complete Iraq is unlikely, even in the range of ten to fifteen years. This fact is supported by the continued presence of American troops in South Korea, the Balkans, and even in stable Western Europe.
