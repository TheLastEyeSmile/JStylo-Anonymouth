 "Claude ï¿½ Gueux "will certainly enable easy identification of the main character, unfortunately the situation of victims find themselves in place need to steal, his family with food and shelter. It is difficult to not feel sorry for him, as is the case in trying to feed his family, he is thrown in a prison where the warden repeatedly tortures him, in every possible way. Therefore, when the Gueux eventually kills the warden and a great deal of injustice is Gueux was sentenced to death and eventual implementation of murder feel sense of justice. I find it interesting that it seems to follow the same pattern seen in many Hugo social protest novels, after the accident, while the events start piling up on the accident seem ridiculously unrealistic. Gueux is in the course of just a few pages, and told that his wife four years, imprisoned, a prostitute, told that his child is gone, only to lose him makes a friend to, and is sentenced to the death penalty for killing the man who had become his tormenting him for so long. The story seems a certain amount of willing suspension of disbelief to accept that someone could be dismantled as well as Claude Gueux could be and as good a person as light and require completely by the injustices in society. Shortness of breath in the story do not know to stop from becoming a lot of problems this is too not that believable talk more long form fiction until this story is a possibility has been adapted is that. The authors are also very pointed remarks at the time. On several occasions, he made sarcastic comments on the evils of the society. Speaking of an Abbey turned into a prison, and specifically a pillory altar be, says "this is called progress." At the end of the story, voice of the author changes the Narrator to the teacher as he noted on several occasions problems in the current status quo of the society. I cannot imagine why, except that the author had problems expressing all the things he wanted to say through the narration. Hugo seems to me very much trying to find his voice-he knows exactly what he wants to say, but is still on the proper way to print interpretation.  All in all, however, it is quite fun to read. Although to a certain extent predictable, readers can be sure by the end of the story to die Gueux crafted Hugo's plot is quite innovative. Sympathetic as a man was trying to do something for his care of his family only at Goo had is easy. Hugo is obviously a well developed the notion that it is to be a good person, and this is a bad. And will agree to situations that require a problem man stealing his most people that need steal man for his family like he was, if not a delivers.
